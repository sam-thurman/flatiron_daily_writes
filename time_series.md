Time series data is data that is structured in relation to some time interval.  Over time, ideally this data would display different behavior than the day before.  Examples of time series data would be stock price changes, traffic on a website, pandemic disease spread etc.  When modeling with time series data, you want to remove as many of the trends as possible (overall trend, seasonal trends) in your errors so that your model only produce errors that can be described as white noise.  We want all of the trends to be captured by the model itself.  Often when working with time series data, the phenomenon we want to capture with a time series is a dataset being correlated with itself.  Of course datasets are perfectlyh correlated with themselves but what we mean is that the current time series is correlated with a previous version of itself; meaning we can make predictions about time series data by looking at the data that came before it.  How to do this :
- rolling documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html). Create a rolling object (specify window) which you can call sum() mean() etc. to create summary data points for specified windows
- resampling documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html#pandas.DataFrame.resample)
